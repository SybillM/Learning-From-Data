# Learning-From-Data
Reflections
1.	Reflections on your learnings between this assignment and the previous one.
After using both Python and Excel for data analysis, I learned that Python provides greater control and flexibility over the data analysis process than Excel. Excel is restricted to using built-in functions and formulas, but Python allows you to create your own functions and algorithms. Also, Python has a steeper learning curve since it takes some programming skills, but Excel is more approachable and simpler to learn.

2.	What was different between Python and Excel? When will you use either of them? 
Excel is a spreadsheet program that is generally used by non-programmers for data analysis. Excel offers a user-friendly interface for organizing and your analysing data, it also has a variety of built-in formulas and functions that may be used to alter and interpret data. Excel works well with smaller datasets and straightforward data analysis tasks. Python, on the other hand, is used for a wide range of activities, including data processing. Python is better suited for larger and more complex data analysis jobs that call for more sophisticated programming and statistical analysis approaches.

3.	If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? What are the gaps in your programming or stats knowledge?
Before performing my analysis, I had forgotten to ensure that the data is clean, complete, and properly formatted. Which involves techniques such as handling missing data, dealing with outliers, and transforming variables. So, I lacked to understand data cleaning and preparation techniques.  But I was able to create my own functions and algorithms to clean my data when I was computing the calculations.
